## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) 
- [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/) - for mail validation


### What I learned

This was my first time using Vue.js and tailwindcss in a project. I have much to learn, but I am happy with the result. Tlearned how to style components with tailwindcss, how to set up different colours as variables. I tried to use Vuelidate for mail validation, but I could not make it work to mi liking, so I decided to validate the input with tailwind instead.
