## My process

I looked at the desktop and mobile layout and divided the site into a few different containers (header, top container and bottom container). After that I have written some basic code for the theme switcher. At first I was only concerned with it working. I was planning on tweaking it later. After that I have written all of the basic styling for containers. First the background and basic positioning for mobile layout, after that I stylied text and images. I styled every component until I was happy with the result..

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Theme toggle](https://github.com/saadeghi/theme-change) - tiny JS script to handle CSS themes
- [Svelte theme Switcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-theme-switcher) - A happy little svelte theme switcher to brighten or maybe darken your day ðŸŒž.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS framework


### What I learned

I learned how to toggle tark mode in Svelte. Who would have thought that it takes just a few lines of code. I also learned how to do a linear-gradient border.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  /*---This is how to do a gradient border---*/
  .ini{
    background: 
    linear-gradient(hsl(37, 97%, 70%), hsl(329, 70%, 58%)) padding-box,
    linear-gradient(hsl(37, 97%, 70%), hsl(329, 70%, 58%)) border-box;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border-top: 3px solid transparent;
  width:326px;
}
}
```
```js
function toggle() {
    window.document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode')
}
}
```



### Continued development

Learn more about Svelte. I want to tweak this projest a bit more in the future.
