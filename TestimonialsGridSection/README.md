## My process
I divided the site into five different containers. One for each testimonial. I have written HTML for each of the containers first. Added global CSS styles for font, headers and images. After that I stiled each container individually with CSS. I have positioned the items on the page using grid.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS framework


### What I learned

I learned basics of Svelte. 

### Continued development

I want to focus more on learning Javascript and honing my Svelte skills.
